Apache Lucene is widely used throughout the industry and has a very permissive license. Here's information about its licensing and industry adoption:

## Apache Lucene Licensing

Apache Lucene is licensed under the **Apache License 2.0**, which is one of the most permissive and business-friendly open-source licenses. This license:

- Allows free use, modification, and distribution
- Permits commercial use with no royalties
- Does not require derivative works to be open source
- Requires inclusion of the license and copyright notice
- Includes a patent grant

This permissive licensing is one reason Lucene has been so widely adopted across industries.

## Major Organizations Using Apache Lucene

Apache Lucene (and its search platform Solr) are used by many major organizations:

1. **LinkedIn** - Uses Lucene for its search functionality
2. **Twitter** - Uses Lucene for its search infrastructure
3. **Netflix** - Uses Lucene/Solr for content discovery
4. **Instagram** - Uses Lucene for search and discovery
5. **Adobe** - Incorporates Lucene in various products
6. **Salesforce** - Uses Lucene in its search solutions

10. **The Eclipse Foundation** - Uses Lucene for code search

## Specific Address-Related Use Cases

For address parsing and matching specifically:

1. **USPS** - While they have proprietary systems, they use Lucene components in some of their address management tools
2. **Delivery and logistics companies** - Many use Lucene-based solutions for address matching and geocoding
3. **UPS and FedEx** - Use similar fuzzy matching techniques for address validation
4. **Real estate platforms** (Zillow, Redfin) - Use Lucene for property and address search
5. **Food delivery apps** (DoorDash, Uber Eats) - Use Lucene-based address matching
