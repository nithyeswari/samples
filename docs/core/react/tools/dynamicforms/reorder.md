Key Features

Simple Click-based Interface:

Use dropdown menus to move fields into groups
Each group has buttons to add available fields
"Move Out" button to remove fields from groups


JSON Import/Export:

Load fields from JSON in the input textarea
Export the final structure with groups to JSON
Maintains all field properties


Field Organization:

Add groups with the "Add Group" button
Move any field into any group with a simple dropdown
Add fields to groups directly with buttons below each group
Clear visual distinction between grouped and ungrouped fields



This approach is much more reliable than drag-and-drop, which can be finicky in web interfaces. The simplified design focuses on getting the job done without requiring precise mouse movements.
How to Use

Load your JSON with the "Load Fields" button
Add groups with the "+ Add Group" button
Move fields into groups using either:

The "Move to group..." dropdown next to each field
The field buttons displayed under each group


Organize groups by adding or removing fields as needed
Export the result with the "Export JSON" button

The JSON output will include your original fields organized into the groups you've created, maintaining the same structure that would have been created with drag-and-drop.
